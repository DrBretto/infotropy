# Matter.js Simulation Module

## Description for Description Section

A simple physics simulation using Matter.js, demonstrating basic rigid body dynamics with boundaries and bouncing balls.

## Technical Details

This module implements a basic 2D physics simulation using the Matter.js library. It renders the simulation onto a canvas element within the component.

- **Technology:** Matter.js
- **Functionality:**
  - Initializes a Matter.js engine, renderer, and world.
  - Creates static boundaries around the canvas edge.
  - Adds dynamic circular bodies (balls) with restitution (bounciness).
  - Runs the simulation loop.
  - Handles canvas resizing to maintain responsiveness.
  - Cleans up the Matter.js instance on component unmount.

## Component Structure

- `src/modules/matterjs-simulation/MatterJsSimulation.tsx`: The main React component containing the Matter.js setup and rendering logic.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex shapes and constraints.
- Implement user interaction (e.g., dragging bodies, adding new bodies).
- Integrate with other modules or data sources.
- Optimize performance for larger simulations.
