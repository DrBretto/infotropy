# Animation Strategy

This document outlines the animation strategy for the Infotropy front-end project, focusing on creating smooth and engaging transitions between different layout states using Framer Motion.

## Core Animation Principles

- **State-Driven:** Animations are triggered by changes in the application's layout state (e.g., transitioning from the 'menu' state to a 'module' state).
- **Smooth Transitions:** Aim for fluid and visually appealing transitions that enhance the user experience without being distracting.
- **Performance:** Optimize animations for performance to ensure a smooth experience across different devices.
- **Consistency:** Apply a consistent style and duration to similar types of animations.

## Animation Library: Framer Motion

[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is the recommended animation library for this project. It provides a declarative API for creating animations and gestures in React, making it well-suited for state-driven animations.

## Key Animation Areas

1.  **Layout Transitions (Menu to Module and vice versa):**

    - **Header Transformation:** Animate the Header component's size, position, and content as it transitions from the prominent title in the 'menu' state to the compact navigation bar in the 'module' state.
    - **Central Content Window:** Animate the entry and exit of the Module Menu and individual Module Components within the Central Content Window. This could involve:
      - **Fading:** Components fade in and out.
      - **Sliding:** Components slide in from a direction (e.g., from the side or bottom).
      - **Scaling:** Components scale up or down.
    - **Description Section:** Animate the content update and potential repositioning of the Description Section.

2.  **Module Entry/Exit Animations:**
    - When a module is selected from the menu, animate the transition from the clicked menu item's position to the full view within the Central Content Window. This could involve animating the size and position of a container element.
    - When navigating back to the menu, animate the module component exiting the view.

## Implementation with Framer Motion

- Use the `motion` component to apply animations to elements.
- Define `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props to specify animation states.
- Use the `transition` prop to customize animation duration, easing, and delay.
- Leverage the `AnimatePresence` component to animate components that are being mounted or unmounted (e.g., when switching between the Module Menu and a Module Component).
- Coordinate animations across multiple components by passing state or using animation controls.

## Implementation Notes

- Install Framer Motion: `npm install framer-motion`
- Refer to the Framer Motion documentation for detailed usage examples.
- Experiment with different animation properties and transitions to achieve the desired look and feel.
- Ensure animations are performant, especially on lower-end devices.
